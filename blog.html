                <p>Yesterday, I had some free time so I decided to visit the new bar in theneighborhood. What I didn'r
                    realize was that G A Y, the bar's name, actually meant gay. The bar was for gay men.
                </p>

                <p>I have never like women too much but it was when I saw one of the beautifully scluptureddacers on the
                    floor that I relized I liked men</p>

                <p>In conclusion, I like men now.</p>

                <p>Understanding the pain I have caused withmy inappropriate joke. I would like to issue this offcial

                    being gay. </p>
