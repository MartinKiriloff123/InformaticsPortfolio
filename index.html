            <p> My name is Martin Kirilov and I am, was, the ruler of a kingdom called M-World. This is a message from
                the future. You have been chosen to learn the secrets of the rise and fall of my empire in order to
                hopefully prevent it. While our neighbors focused on military development we advanced in the realms os
                science and technology. With the help of our militarydroids we were able to conquer the neighboring
                kingdoms and for 300 years I ruled as the king of the world, until they showed up... Our compters have
                estimated that the development of this website and showing it to you is the only way to save the world.
                While these pages may seem like the work of a 12th grade studen at the American college of Sofia, they
                are in fact carefully chosen to impact you and change the course of history. Good luck!</p>
